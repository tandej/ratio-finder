# e12-ratio-finder

Quick script to approximate ratios between numbers in a set. 

Currently uses the [E12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_series_of_preferred_numbers#) set of values, which are typical values for electronic components (e.g. resistors, capacitors, inductors), since certain circuits need certain ratios of these to be constructed and I don't wanna do that by hand >_<

(Current/voltage) dividers will be implemented... eventually.
